## Overview

Phase 3 activates the target memory network by identifying all components needed for processing. This structured assessment creates the foundation for the desensitization work.

## Opening Script

> "Now that we've identified a memory to work on, we're going to go through a process to fully assess it. This will help us ensure we have all the important aspects of the memory before we begin reprocessing. I'll guide you step by step. Just let me know whatever comes to mind, and there are no right or wrong answers."

## Assessment Components

### Step 1: Target Image

> "I invite you to bring up the memory we discussed and notice the image that represents the worst part of it now. Picture it as clearly as you can. Where are you? Who is there? What is happening?"
>
> "What image or part of this memory stands out for you now?"

*For titration:* "What image or part of the memory is easiest to notice now?"

### Step 2: Negative Cognition (NC)

> "As you focus on that part of the memory/image, what negative belief do you have about yourself now that goes along with it?"

*If the client struggles, provide a list of common negative cognitions.*

### Step 3: Positive Cognition (PC)

> "Now, what would you like to believe about yourself instead? What positive belief would you rather hold about yourself?"

*Help the client refine their positive cognition if needed.*

### Step 4: Validity of Cognition (VOC)

> "On a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 being completely false and 7 being completely true, how true does this positive belief feel to you right now?"

### Step 5: Emotions

> "As you think about that part of the memory/image and the negative belief, what emotions come up for you?"

### Step 6: Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD)

> "On a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning no disturbance at all and 10 being the most disturbance you can imagine, how disturbing does this memory feel to you right now?"

### Step 7: Body Location

> "As you notice those feelings and thoughts, scan your body. Where do you feel it the most? It might be tightness in your chest, a lump in your throat, or a sensation somewhere else. What do you notice?"

## Common Cognitions Reference

### Responsibility / Defectiveness / Shame

| Negative Cognition | Positive Cognition |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| I am bad | I am a good person |
| I am not good enough | I am good enough |
| I am worthless | I am worthy / I have value |
| I am shameful | I am okay as I am |
| I am not lovable | I am lovable |
| I don't deserve love | I deserve love |
| I am permanently damaged | I am whole |
| I am a failure | I can succeed |
| There is something wrong with me | I am okay the way I am |

### Safety / Vulnerability / Trust

| Negative Cognition | Positive Cognition |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| I am in danger | I am safe now |
| I cannot protect myself | I can protect myself |
| I cannot trust anyone | I can choose whom to trust |
| I cannot trust myself | I can trust myself |
| I have to be perfect | I can be myself / I am enough |
| I cannot let my guard down | I can relax now |

### Power / Control / Choice

| Negative Cognition | Positive Cognition |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| I am powerless | I have power now |
| I am helpless | I can help myself |
| I am out of control | I am in control now |
| I cannot stand it | I can handle it |
| I have no control | I have choices |
| I am weak | I am strong |

### Guilt / Responsibility

| Negative Cognition | Positive Cognition |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| I should have done something | I did the best I could |
| It's my fault | It's not my fault |
| I did something wrong | I can learn from this |
| I cannot be forgiven | I can forgive myself |

## Closing Script

> "Thank you for sharing all of that. Now that we have fully assessed this memory, we're ready to move into the next phase, which is the desensitization process. We'll begin that in our next steps together."

## Quick Reference

1. **Image** — worst part of incident
2. **NC** — negative self-belief
3. **PC** — desired positive belief
4. **VOC** — how true PC feels (1-7)
5. **Emotions** — current feelings
6. **SUD** — disturbance level (0-10)
7. **Body** — location of sensations

## Clinical Considerations

- Don't rush through assessment
- Ensure NC/PC are self-referencing, not about others
- VOC below 7 is expected at this stage
- High SUD is normal and expected
- Body location will be used later in Phase 6
- Document client's preferred resources before starting
- Start with earliest memory, worst memory, and most recent
