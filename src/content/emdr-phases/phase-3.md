## Overview

Phase 3 activates the target memory network by identifying all components needed for processing. This structured assessment creates the foundation for the desensitization work.

## Key Components

### Target Image

Ask the client:

> "What image represents the worst part of the incident?"

The image should be a specific snapshot, not a movie.

### Negative Cognition (NC)

Identify the irrational, negative self-belief:

> "What words go best with that image that express your negative belief about yourself now?"

Common themes: responsibility, safety, control/choice

**Examples:**
- "I am powerless"
- "I am not safe"
- "It's my fault"
- "I should have done something"

### Positive Cognition (PC)

Identify the desired belief:

> "When you bring up that image, what would you like to believe about yourself now?"

The PC should be:
- Realistic and achievable
- In the present tense
- Self-referencing
- Matching the NC theme

### Validity of Cognition (VOC)

Rate the PC on a scale of 1-7:

> "When you think of the incident, how true do those words [PC] feel to you now, on a scale of 1-7, where 1 feels completely false and 7 feels completely true?"

### Emotions

Identify the emotions:

> "When you bring up that image and those words [NC], what emotion(s) do you feel now?"

### Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD)

Rate distress on a scale of 0-10:

> "On a scale of 0-10, where 0 is no disturbance and 10 is the highest disturbance you can imagine, how disturbing does it feel to you now?"

### Body Location

Identify where sensations are felt:

> "Where do you feel it in your body?"

## Quick Reference

1. Target image — worst part of incident
2. Negative cognition — irrational self-belief
3. Positive cognition — desired belief
4. VOC — how true PC feels (1-7)
5. Emotions — current feelings
6. SUD — disturbance level (0-10)
7. Body location — where sensations are felt

## Clinical Considerations

- Don't rush through assessment
- Ensure NC/PC are self-referencing, not about others
- VOC below 7 is expected at this stage
- High SUD is normal and expected
- Body location will be used later in Phase 6
