## Overview

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for all subsequent EMDR work. This phase involves comprehensive history-taking, case conceptualization, and treatment planning.

## Intake Assessment Components

### Client Information
- DOB/Age
- Caregiver's Name and Relation
- Date of Referral and Intake
- Counselor assigned

### Risk Assessment
Assess for risk factors before proceeding with treatment planning.

### Client Goals
Document what the client hopes to achieve through treatment.

### Client Strengths
Identify existing coping skills, support systems, and resources.

### Trauma History
Gather detailed history of traumatic experiences.

### Triggers
Document triggers identified by caregivers at intake and ongoing.

### Attachment Styles
Consider using the Attachment Style Questionnaire – Short Form (ASQ-SF) for ages 15+.

### Clinical Considerations
- Medical history and special considerations
- Current medications
- Previous treatment history

## Clinical Assessments

Administer appropriate assessments:
- **UCLA PTSD Reaction Index** — Trauma symptom measure
- **Dissociation screening** — Essential before processing
- **Affect tolerance assessment** — Can client manage distress?
- **Avoidance types** — Identify patterns of avoidance
- **Trauma phobias** — Specific fears related to trauma

## Treatment Planning

### Target Identification Methods

**Trace Back Procedure:**
Identify targets by tracing current symptoms back to their origins.

**Affect Scan Procedure:**
Use current emotional and body sensations to identify connected memories.

### Three-Pronged Approach

Create a treatment plan addressing:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Past** | Trauma memories that set the template |
| **Present** | Current symptoms and triggers |
| **Future** | Desired future scenarios |

## Quick Reference

1. Complete intake assessment
2. Assess risk factors and stability
3. Administer clinical measures
4. Identify client goals and strengths
5. Document trauma history
6. Identify triggers
7. Create target sequence using Trace Back or Affect Scan
8. Develop treatment plan

## Clinical Considerations

- Allow adequate time for thorough history-taking
- Use standardized measures appropriate for client's age
- Document informed consent for EMDR treatment
- Consider cultural factors in case conceptualization
- Ensure client has adequate support system
- Screen for dissociation before proceeding to processing
