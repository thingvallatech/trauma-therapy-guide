## Overview

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for all subsequent EMDR work. This phase involves comprehensive history-taking, case conceptualization, and treatment planning.

## Key Components

### Client History

Gather information about:

- **Presenting problem** — Current symptoms and their impact on daily functioning
- **Trauma history** — Past experiences that may be contributing to current symptoms
- **Medical history** — Relevant health conditions and medications
- **Previous treatment** — What has been tried before and outcomes
- **Strengths and resources** — Coping skills, support systems

### Assessing Readiness

Before proceeding with EMDR processing, evaluate:

- **Stability** — Is the client stable enough for trauma processing?
- **Ego strength** — Can they tolerate distressing material?
- **Life circumstances** — Are there ongoing crises that need to be addressed first?
- **Dissociation** — Screen for dissociative symptoms that may require modified protocols

### Target Selection

Identify potential targets using:

- **Touchstone memories** — Earlier experiences that set the template
- **Current triggers** — Present-day situations causing distress
- **Future templates** — Desired future scenarios

## Quick Reference

1. Build rapport and explain EMDR
2. Take comprehensive history
3. Identify negative cognitions and target memories
4. Assess client's readiness and stability
5. Develop treatment plan with client

## Clinical Considerations

- Allow adequate time for thorough history-taking
- Use standardized measures when appropriate (PCL-5, IES-R, etc.)
- Document informed consent for EMDR treatment
- Consider cultural factors in case conceptualization
