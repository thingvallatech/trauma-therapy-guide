shortTitle: "Body Scan"
description: "Identifying and processing any residual physical tension or sensation associated with the target memory."
goals:
  - "Identify residual body sensations"
  - "Process remaining physical disturbance"
  - "Ensure complete processing"
  - "Clear somatic storage of trauma"

## Overview

Phase 6 addresses the body's storage of traumatic material. Even when cognitive and emotional processing is complete, the body may hold residual tension or sensation.

## Key Components

### Scanning for Residual Disturbance

After VOC reaches 7 (or ecological), instruct:

> "Close your eyes and keep in mind the original incident and the positive cognition. Then bring your attention to the different parts of your body, starting with your head and working downward. Any place you find any tension, tightness, or unusual sensation, tell me."

### Processing Body Sensations

If the client reports sensations:

**Positive or neutral sensations:**
> "Focus on that." [Begin BLS]

Continue until sensations strengthen or neutralize.

**Negative sensations:**
> "Focus on that." [Begin BLS]

Continue until sensations clear. This may open new channels of processing.

### Complete Body Scan

When client reports body is clear:

Repeat the body scan to confirm all sensations have been processed.

Target is complete when:
- SUD = 0 (or ecological)
- VOC = 7 (or ecological)
- Body scan is clear

## Quick Reference

1. Hold target + positive cognition
2. Scan body from head to toe
3. Report any tension, tightness, or sensation
4. Process with BLS until clear
5. Repeat body scan to confirm completion

## Clinical Considerations

- Body sensations may reveal unprocessed material
- New memories or emotions may emerge
- This is not relaxation — it's processing
- Some sensations may be somatic flashbacks
- Don't skip this phase even if client seems complete
- Document body scan results
