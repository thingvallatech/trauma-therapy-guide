phase: 6
title: "Body Scan"
shortTitle: "Body Scan"
description: "Identifying and processing any residual physical tension or sensation associated with the target memory."
goals:
  - "Identify residual body sensations"
  - "Process remaining physical disturbance"
  - "Ensure complete processing"
  - "Clear somatic storage of trauma"

## Overview

Phase 6 addresses the body's storage of traumatic material. Even when cognitive and emotional processing is complete, the body may hold residual tension or sensation.

## Opening Script

> "Now we're going to do a body scan. This helps us check if your body feels calm and if the positive thoughts are really sinking in. We want to see if there's any leftover stress or tension anywhere, so we can help it go away."

## Body Scan Steps

### Step 1: Guide the Body Scan

> "Bring up the original memory we are working with along with the positive belief we installed. As you hold them together, scan your body from head to toe. Just notice any sensations—tension, discomfort, warmth, or ease—without trying to change anything."

*Allow time for the client to scan and report any sensations.*

### Step 2: Process Any Distress

> "Did you notice anything uncomfortable or distressing in your body?"

**If no distress:** Proceed to closure or Future Template.

**If distress is present:** Use BLS to process.

> "Let's focus on that sensation and notice whatever comes up."

**Begin BLS (24-36 passes)**

> "Take a breath. What do you notice now?"

*Continue BLS as needed until discomfort subsides.*

### Step 3: Reinforce Positive Integration

> "If your body feels clear, focus again on the positive belief. As you hold that belief, notice any feelings of strength, calm, or confidence in your body."

**Do a final set of BLS to reinforce.**

## Target Completion Criteria

Target is complete when:
- SUD = 0 (or ecological)
- VOC = 7 (or ecological)
- Body scan is clear

## Future Template (Optional)

If time allows, proceed to Future Template before closure:

### Future Template Script

> "Now that we've worked through the hard memory and your brain feels stronger, let's think about something that might happen in the future—a situation where you can use your new strengths."

> "Can you think of something that used to feel scary or hard—but now, with your strong thoughts like [state PC], you could handle it differently?"

*Help client identify a realistic future situation.*

> "Great. Let's imagine that scene in your mind—like a little movie. See yourself there, doing what you want to do. Notice what you're thinking, how your body feels, and how you're handling it."

*Pause*

> "Let's add your new strong thought into the movie."

**Begin BLS**

> "What did you notice? Did anything feel weird or did it go well?"

*If distress arises, pause and explore. If positive, continue BLS.*

> "Let's do it one more time. Really imagine yourself using your strengths—calm, confident, and in control."

**Repeat BLS to strengthen the template. End when the future scene feels solid and positive.**

## Quick Reference

1. Hold target + positive cognition
2. Scan body from head to toe
3. Report any tension, tightness, or sensation
4. Process sensations with BLS until clear
5. Repeat body scan to confirm completion
6. Optional: Complete Future Template
7. Move to Closure (Phase 7)

## Clinical Considerations

- Body sensations may reveal unprocessed material
- New memories or emotions may emerge
- This is not relaxation—it's processing
- Some sensations may be somatic flashbacks
- Don't skip this phase even if client seems complete
- Document body scan results
- If time permits, Future Template strengthens gains
