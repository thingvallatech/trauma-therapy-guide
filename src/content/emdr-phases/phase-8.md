## Overview

Phase 8 occurs at the beginning of each session after processing has begun, and throughout treatment. It ensures that processing gains are maintained and guides ongoing treatment planning.

## Opening Script

> "Reevaluation occurs at the beginning of each session. This is where we check in on the progress of the work we've done so far and ensure that the positive changes are lasting."

## Reevaluation Steps

### Step 1: General Check-In

> "How have you been since our last session? What has stood out to you? Have any changes or memories come up?"

*Allow the client to describe any shifts, new insights, or emotional experiences since the last session.*

*If the client still experiences distress related to the target memory, assess the level and decide if additional processing is needed.*

### Step 2: Assess the Target Memory

> "Let's bring up the target memory we worked on last time. When you think about that memory now, what comes up for you?"

- If no distress or low distress (SUD 0-2): proceed with reinforcing positive changes
- If distress remains high (SUD 3+): check for new material or blocks that need processing

### Step 3: Assess the Positive Cognition

> "Now, think about the positive belief we installed last time. How true does it feel to you now on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means 'completely false' and 7 means 'completely true'?"

*If VOC is below 7, explore possible reasons for this shift and consider reprocessing or strengthening the positive belief.*

### Step 4: Body Scan Reassessment

> "Let's do a quick body scan together. Bring up the target memory and the positive belief you've been working with, and notice if there's any discomfort or tension in your body."

*Guide the client to notice any areas of discomfort.*

*If there's lingering tension or distress, process it with BLS.*

*If the body scan is clear, continue reinforcing progress.*

### Step 5: Address New Material

> "If anything new has come up since our last session, or if there's still any unresolved material related to the target memory, we can continue to process it."

*If necessary, return to the memory, emotions, or beliefs that still need to be worked on.*

### Step 6: Check Current Distress Level

> "Now, on a scale from 0 to 10, how much distress or discomfort does this memory still bring up for you?"

*If SUD score is elevated, proceed with further processing.*

### Step 7: Reinforce Progress

> "Now that we've processed the memory and emotions, let's take a moment to focus on the positive belief that we worked on. Does it feel more integrated now?"

*If the positive belief feels strong, continue to reinforce it.*

*If doubts or blocks arise, address them.*

## TICES Log

Recommend clients track between-session experiences using a TICES log:

> "Did you notice any changes about your target problem since your last EMDR session? Write down what triggered you, what picture or image came to mind when you were triggered, any thoughts or emotions that you experienced, any body sensations you felt, and how much it bothered you on the SUD scale (0 = no stress at all and 10 = the most stressful)."

| Date | Trigger | Picture | Thoughts | Emotions | Body Feeling | SUD |
|------|---------|---------|----------|----------|--------------|-----|
| | | | | | | |

## Treatment Progress Checklist

Periodically evaluate:

- **Original symptoms** — Are presenting problems improving?
- **Target completion** — How many targets have been processed?
- **Generalization** — Have gains generalized to similar situations?
- **New targets** — Have new issues emerged that need attention?

## Three-Pronged Protocol

Ensure comprehensive treatment of:

1. **Past memories** — Original events that set the template
2. **Present triggers** — Current situations that activate distress
3. **Future templates** — Positive future scenarios

Treatment is complete when all three prongs have been addressed.

## Quick Reference

### Session Opening
1. General check-in since last session
2. Assess previous target (SUD, new material)
3. Check VOC of installed PC
4. Body scan reassessment
5. Determine session focus

### Treatment Planning
1. Evaluate symptom improvement
2. Check target completion
3. Assess for new targets
4. Ensure three-pronged approach
5. Plan for termination when goals are met

## Clinical Considerations

- If SUD increases, more processing is needed
- New material may reveal additional targets
- Use standardized measures periodically (UCLA, PCL-5, etc.)
- Collaborate with client on treatment priorities
- Document progress systematically
- TICES log helps identify patterns and new triggers
- Plan for termination when all targets are complete and gains are stable
