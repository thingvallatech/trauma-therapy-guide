## Overview

Phase 8 occurs at the beginning of each session after processing has begun, and throughout treatment. It ensures that processing gains are maintained and guides ongoing treatment planning.

## Key Components

### Session-Opening Reevaluation

At the start of each session:

1. **Check previous target:**
   > "When you think about [the target we worked on last session], what comes up now?"

   Check for:
   - Maintained gains (SUD should stay at 0)
   - New associations or insights
   - Triggered material

2. **Review between-session experiences:**
   > "What did you notice between sessions? Any dreams, thoughts, or new memories?"

3. **Determine session focus:**
   - If previous target is not complete, continue processing
   - If new material emerged, assess priority
   - If previous target is stable, move to next target

### Treatment Progress Evaluation

Periodically evaluate:

- **Original symptoms** — Are presenting problems improving?
- **Target completion** — How many targets have been processed?
- **Generalization** — Have gains generalized to similar situations?
- **New targets** — Have new issues emerged that need attention?

### Three-Pronged Protocol

Ensure comprehensive treatment of:

1. **Past memories** — Original events that set the template
2. **Present triggers** — Current situations that activate distress
3. **Future templates** — Positive future scenarios

Treatment is complete when all three prongs have been addressed.

## Quick Reference

### Each Session Opening
1. Check previous target (SUD, new material)
2. Review between-session experiences
3. Determine session focus

### Treatment Planning
1. Evaluate symptom improvement
2. Check target completion
3. Assess for new targets
4. Ensure three-pronged approach

## Clinical Considerations

- If SUD increases, more processing is needed
- New material may reveal additional targets
- Use standardized measures periodically
- Collaborate with client on treatment priorities
- Document progress systematically
- Plan for termination when goals are met
