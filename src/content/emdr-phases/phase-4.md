## Overview

Phase 4 is where the actual reprocessing occurs. Using bilateral stimulation, the client processes the target memory while the clinician facilitates the natural healing process.

## Key Components

### Beginning Processing

Start with:

> "Bring up the image, the negative cognition [state it], notice where you feel it in your body, and follow my fingers."

Begin bilateral stimulation (BLS):
- Eye movements, taps, or tones
- Sets of 24-36 or until there's a shift
- Speed and type can be adjusted based on client response

### Between Sets

After each set, say:

> "Take a breath. Let it go. What do you notice now?"

**Key principle:** Let whatever happens, happen.

### Following the Process

The client may experience:
- New images or memories
- Emotions (sometimes intense)
- Body sensations
- Insights or new thoughts
- Nothing (this is okay too)

After each set, simply acknowledge and continue:

> "Go with that." [Begin BLS]

### Returning to Target

When processing stalls or loops, return to target:

> "When you go back to the original incident, what do you get now?"

Check SUD if client reports calm or neutral:

> "On a scale of 0-10, how disturbing does it feel now?"

### Cognitive Interweaves

Use only when processing is stuck:

- Responsibility: "Whose fault was it really?"
- Safety: "Is it over? Are you safe now?"
- Choices: "What choices did you have as a child?"

## Quick Reference

1. Activate target (image + NC + body)
2. Begin bilateral stimulation
3. "What do you notice?" after each set
4. "Go with that" — continue processing
5. Return to target when needed
6. Check SUD when client reports calm
7. Continue until SUD = 0 or ecological

## Clinical Considerations

- Trust the process — avoid leading
- Incomplete sessions require proper closure (Phase 7)
- High abreaction is not always necessary for healing
- Watch for looping or blocking patterns
- Use cognitive interweaves sparingly
- Document channel changes during processing
