## Overview

Phase 4 is where the actual reprocessing occurs. Using bilateral stimulation, the client processes the target memory while the clinician facilitates the natural healing process.

## Setup Script

> "Remember that this is not happening now and you are safe. I am right here with you. Let whatever happens happen, just notice what is coming up for you. Any thoughts, images, emotions and body sensations. Remember that there is no right or wrong, just watch what is coming up and notice them as you would observe the scenery from a moving train. You also can use your stop signal if needed."

## Beginning Processing

> "Now I am inviting you to hold in your mind and body:
> - The image
> - The negative belief: [state NC]
> - The emotions: [state emotions]
> - That you feel in your [body location]
>
> And I am going to [client's preferred BLS method] for you to follow."

**Begin bilateral stimulation (24-36 passes, approximately 30 seconds)**

## Between Sets

After each set:

> "Let's stop, take a breath, let it go… What are you noticing now?"

or

> "What is happening now?"

### Continue Processing

After client reports:

> "Go with that."

or

> "Notice that."

**Resume BLS (24-36 passes, approximately 30 seconds)**

## Processing Guidelines

### Stay Out of the Way

Processing continues spontaneously for the entire session unless:
- Information processing stalls
- Two consecutive negative responses
- Client shifts into hypo or hyper arousal (use interweave)
- Client uses stop signal

### What Clients May Experience

- New images or memories
- Different emotions (sometimes intense)
- Body sensations shifting
- Insights or new thoughts
- Nothing noticeable (this is okay)

## Returning to Target

When processing stalls or loops:

> "When you go back to the original incident, what do you get now?"

Check SUD if client reports calm or neutral:

> "On a scale of 0-10, how disturbing does it feel now?"

## Cognitive Interweaves

Use **only** when processing is stuck:

**Responsibility:**
> "Whose fault was it really?"

**Safety:**
> "Is it over? Are you safe now?"

**Choices:**
> "What choices did you have as a child?"

## When to Move to Phase 5

Continue Phase 4 until:
- SUD = 0, or
- SUD is ecological (as low as it can realistically get)

## Quick Reference

1. Remind client of safety and stop signal
2. Activate target (image + NC + emotions + body)
3. Begin bilateral stimulation (24-36 passes)
4. "What do you notice?" after each set
5. "Go with that" — continue processing
6. Return to target when needed
7. Check SUD when client reports calm
8. Continue until SUD = 0 or ecological

## Clinical Considerations

- Trust the process — avoid leading
- Incomplete sessions require proper closure (Phase 7)
- High abreaction is not always necessary for healing
- Watch for looping or blocking patterns
- Use cognitive interweaves sparingly
- Document channel changes during processing
- If session ends before SUD reaches 0, use Phase 7 closure
