## Overview

Phase 7 closes every EMDR session, ensuring the client leaves in a stable state. The closure process differs depending on whether processing is complete or incomplete.

## Opening Script

> "We are now moving into the closure phase. Whether we fully processed the memory today or still have more work to do, the goal of this phase is to ensure you feel stable and grounded before we end the session."

## Closure Steps

### Step 1: Assess Current State

> "Take a moment to check in with yourself. How are you feeling right now?"

*Allow the client to share their emotional and physical state.*

- If client reports feeling calm and regulated: proceed with closure techniques
- If client is distressed: use grounding and containment strategies

### Step 2: Containment (for Incomplete Processing)

> "If there's anything unresolved from today's session, I want to remind you that your brain will continue processing between now and our next session. For now, let's place anything unfinished in a safe container until we're ready to return to it."

*Guide the client through visualization of placing the material in a secure container—a locked box, vault, or other safe container in their mind.*

> "Your mind knows where it is, and we can come back to it when you're ready."

### Step 3: Grounding Techniques

> "I'd like to help you feel even more present before we wrap up. Let's do a grounding exercise."

Choose one or more based on client's needs:
- Breathing exercise
- Five senses awareness
- Safe place visualization

### Step 4: Reorient to Present

> "Notice your feet on the ground, the chair supporting you, and the space around you. You are here, in the present moment, and you are safe."

*Ensure the client is fully present before proceeding.*

### Step 5: Between-Session Processing Education

> "Your brain may continue processing what we worked on today, even in dreams or unexpected moments. If anything comes up between now and our next session, just notice it without judgment. You can write it down if you'd like, or use your grounding skills to stay present."

> "If you feel overwhelmed, use your safe place or grounding exercises. If anything feels too intense, we can address it in our next session."

### Step 6: Final Check-In

> "Before we finish, is there anything else you need to feel grounded and settled?"

*Address any final concerns.*

> "Great job today. Take care of yourself, and we'll continue next time."

## Complete vs. Incomplete Session Closure

### Complete Processing Closure

When target is fully processed (SUD = 0, VOC = 7, clear body scan):

1. Acknowledge the work completed
2. Brief debrief
3. Remind about potential continued processing
4. End session

### Incomplete Processing Closure

When session ends before processing is complete:

1. Stop processing (allow at least 10-15 minutes for closure)
2. Use Safe/Calm Place with slow BLS
3. Use Containment exercise
4. Debrief and provide instructions
5. Grounding check
6. Ensure client is stable before leaving

## Closure Script for Complete Processing

> "You have done a lot of work today. We may or may not feel like the memory is completely resolved or free of disturbance but keep in mind that each memory is different and some may take one session while others may take several."

> "I would like to invite you to take a few minutes to notice how you are doing and feeling right now. How are you feeling?"

*Pause for client feedback.*

> "I am right here with you and holding the space you need now to return to greater balance."

## Quick Reference

### Complete Session
1. Acknowledge completion
2. Brief debrief
3. Remind about continued processing
4. End session

### Incomplete Session
1. Stop processing with time for closure (10-15 min)
2. Safe/calm place with slow BLS
3. Containment if needed
4. Debrief and instructions
5. Grounding check
6. Ensure stability before leaving

## Clinical Considerations

- Never rush closure
- Incomplete processing is normal and expected
- Client safety is the priority
- Prepare clients for between-session experiences
- Have crisis resources available
- Document session status and closure techniques used
- Recommend TICES log for tracking between-session experiences
