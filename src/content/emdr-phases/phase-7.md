## Overview

Phase 7 closes every EMDR session, ensuring the client leaves in a stable state. The closure process differs depending on whether processing is complete or incomplete.

## Key Components

### Complete Processing

When target is fully processed (SUD = 0, VOC = 7, clear body scan):

1. Acknowledge the work completed
2. Remind about potential between-session processing
3. Review containment strategies if needed
4. End session

### Incomplete Processing

When session ends before processing is complete:

1. **Stop processing** — Allow time for closure (at least 10-15 minutes)

2. **Use safe/calm place:**
   > "I'd like you to bring up your safe/calm place now."

   Apply slow bilateral stimulation to strengthen positive state.

3. **Use containment if needed:**
   > "Imagine placing any remaining disturbing material in your container, knowing you can return to it next session."

4. **Debrief the session:**
   > "The processing we've done today may continue after you leave. You may notice new insights, thoughts, memories, or dreams. If so, just notice what you're experiencing. You can write it down to discuss next session. If you feel overwhelmed, use the techniques we've practiced."

5. **Grounding:**
   Ensure client is oriented to the present before leaving.

### Between-Session Instructions

Provide written or verbal instructions:

- Processing may continue between sessions
- Use coping strategies as needed
- Keep a log of significant experiences
- Contact clinician if overwhelmed

## Quick Reference

### Complete Session
1. Acknowledge completion
2. Debrief briefly
3. Remind about continued processing

### Incomplete Session
1. Stop processing with time for closure
2. Safe/calm place with BLS
3. Containment if needed
4. Debrief and instructions
5. Grounding check

## Clinical Considerations

- Never rush closure
- Incomplete processing is normal
- Client safety is the priority
- Prepare clients for between-session experiences
- Have crisis resources available
- Document session status and closure techniques used
