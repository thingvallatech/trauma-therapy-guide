## Overview

Phase 2 prepares the client for the processing phases by ensuring they have adequate resources for managing distress. This phase is crucial for treatment success and client safety.

## Key Components

### Psychoeducation

Explain to the client:

- How EMDR works and what to expect
- The role of bilateral stimulation
- The metaphor of processing (train, highway, etc.)
- What may come up during processing

### Safe/Calm Place

Guide the client to:

1. Identify a safe or calm place (real or imagined)
2. Develop rich sensory details
3. Associate a cue word with the image
4. Install with bilateral stimulation
5. Practice accessing the resource

### Self-Regulation Techniques

Teach and practice:

- **Container exercise** — Storing distressing material
- **Light stream technique** — For physical tension
- **Breathing techniques** — 4-7-8 breathing, box breathing
- **Grounding techniques** — 5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness

## Quick Reference

1. Explain EMDR process and set expectations
2. Develop safe/calm place resource
3. Teach containment strategies
4. Practice self-regulation techniques
5. Ensure client can self-soothe before proceeding

## Clinical Considerations

- Preparation length varies by client complexity
- Some clients need extensive stabilization work
- Complex trauma may require months of Phase 2 work
- Ensure resources are strong before moving to Phase 3
- Practice between sessions to strengthen resources
