## Overview

Phase 2 prepares the client for the processing phases by ensuring they have adequate resources for managing distress. This phase is crucial for treatment success and client safety.

## Psychoeducation Script

> "Think of your brain like a streaming service with different channels. When something really stressful or upsetting happens, it's like one channel gets stuck, replaying the same scene over and over. No matter how much time passes, that memory can still pop up with the same intensity, making you feel like you're stuck in the past."
>
> "EMDR helps 'unstick' that channel so your brain can process the memory the way it was meant to—like any other event from your past, without it constantly interrupting your present. We do this using bilateral stimulation, which is like pressing 'play' instead of 'rewind.' Eye movements, tapping, or sounds help your brain move the memory along so it stops getting stuck."
>
> "You don't have to force anything—just notice what comes up, and I'll be here to guide you. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions?"

### Child-Friendly Version

> "Your brain is like a train on a track. Most of the time, it moves forward just fine. But if something really upsetting happens, it's like the train gets stuck on a broken piece of track and can't move on. EMDR helps fix that track so your brain train can keep going. We do this with things like tapping or moving your eyes, which helps your brain get unstuck and feel better."

## Assess Readiness & Strengths

> "What helps you manage stress? What makes you feel safe and calm?"

### Signs Client is NOT Ready for Processing

- Suicidal ideation or crisis
- Active self-harming behaviors
- Addictive behaviors
- Lengthy anger outbursts
- Unable to experience positive emotions
- Cannot tolerate calmness
- New medications (allow stabilization)
- Inability to stay present
- Trance states or memory lapses
- Trauma ongoing or occurring presently
- Stability concerns (lack of support system)
- Upcoming court proceedings
- Major life changes (moving, adoption, etc.)

## Grounding & Self-Regulation Techniques

### Safe Place Exercise

> "Imagine a place where you feel safe. What do you see, hear, and feel there?"

### Container Exercise

> "If distressing thoughts arise, visualize placing them in a secure container."

### Light Stream Exercise

> "Imagine a warm, healing light flowing through the body."

### Breathing Techniques

> "Breathe in for four counts, hold for four, exhale for four."

## Establish a Stop Signal

> "If you need to pause, use a stop signal like raising your hand or saying 'stop.' What feels natural to you?"

*For younger children, create a personalized stop sign.*

## Bilateral Stimulation Options

- Eye movement tracking
- Puppet tracking
- Wand following
- Hand taps
- Butterfly Hug
- Gorilla Tapping
- Brushes
- Drum beat
- Tappers
- Magic Headphones
- Marching in place
- Bilateral ball toss
- Bilateral dance moves
- Bilateral drawing
- Hopscotch
- Simon Says

## Reinforce Client's Control

> "You've done great. Use these skills if anything comes up between sessions. How are you feeling now?"
>
> "You are in control. We'll move at your pace and use these tools if needed. Do you feel ready to begin processing next time?"

## Quick Reference

1. Explain EMDR process using age-appropriate metaphor
2. Assess readiness markers
3. Teach Safe Place exercise
4. Teach Container exercise
5. Practice breathing techniques
6. Establish stop signal
7. Introduce and practice BLS method
8. Reinforce client's control

## Clinical Considerations

- Preparation length varies by client complexity
- Some clients need extensive stabilization work
- Complex trauma may require extended Phase 2 work
- Ensure resources are strong before moving to Phase 3
- Practice between sessions to strengthen resources
- Document client's preferred resources and BLS method
