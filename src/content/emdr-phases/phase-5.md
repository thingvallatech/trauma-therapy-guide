## Overview

Phase 5 strengthens and installs the positive cognition identified in Phase 3. This phase links the new, adaptive belief to the original target memory.

## Key Components

### Check the Positive Cognition

First, verify the PC is still valid:

> "When you think of the original incident, do the words [state PC] still fit, or is there another positive statement that feels better?"

The client may have developed a more fitting PC during processing.

### Measure Initial VOC

Check where the PC stands:

> "When you think of the incident, how true do those words [state PC] feel now, on a scale of 1-7?"

### Installation

If VOC is less than 7:

> "Think of the incident and hold it together with the words [state PC]."

Begin bilateral stimulation.

Continue until:
- VOC reaches 7, OR
- VOC is ecological (as high as it can realistically get)

### Ecological Validity

Sometimes VOC won't reach 7 due to:
- Realistic limitations ("I can't be 100% safe")
- Secondary gains that need addressing
- Blocking beliefs that need processing

A VOC of 6 may be ecological. Ask:

> "What prevents it from being a 7?"

If the answer reveals another target, note it for future processing.

## Quick Reference

1. Check if original PC still fits
2. Measure VOC (1-7)
3. Hold incident + PC together
4. Apply bilateral stimulation
5. Continue until VOC = 7 or ecological
6. Address blocking beliefs if needed

## Clinical Considerations

- Don't force VOC to 7 if it's not realistic
- Blocking beliefs may indicate additional targets
- PC should feel true in the gut, not just intellectually
- Installation prepares the ground for Phase 6
- Document final VOC
