## Overview

Phase 5 strengthens and installs the positive cognition identified in Phase 3. This phase links the new, adaptive belief to the original target memory.

## Opening Script

> "We are now moving into the installation phase. This is where we strengthen a positive belief so that it fully integrates with the memory we've been processing. The goal is to help your brain connect the memory with a more adaptive, empowering belief."

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Verify the Positive Cognition

> "We originally identified [state PC] as the belief you'd like to hold about yourself in relation to this memory. Does that still feel right, or would you like to adjust it?"

*If the client wants to modify the belief, collaborate to refine a statement that feels true and empowering.*

### Step 2: Check Validity of Cognition (VOC)

> "On a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means 'completely false' and 7 means 'completely true,' how true does this positive belief feel to you now?"

*If VOC is below 7, continue processing to strengthen the belief.*

### Step 3: Install with BLS

> "Hold the positive belief together with the target memory. Let yourself notice whatever happens as we go."

**Begin BLS (24-36 passes, approximately 30 seconds)**

### Step 4: Check-In

> "Take a breath… let it go. What came up for you?"

or

> "What do you notice?"

*Allow the client to describe any shifts in thoughts, feelings, or body sensations.*

> "Let's go with that."

**Continue BLS, checking in periodically until getting 2 same responses or no new information.**

*If the belief strengthens, continue BLS. If doubts or blocks arise, explore and process them as needed. Use interweaves when client shifts into hypo or hyper arousal.*

### Step 5: Reassess VOC

> "Now, on that same scale from 1 to 7, how true does this belief feel to you?"

- If VOC reaches 7: proceed to Body Scan (Phase 6)
- If VOC below 7: continue processing or explore barriers

## When VOC Won't Reach 7

Sometimes VOC won't reach 7 due to:
- Realistic limitations ("I can't be 100% safe")
- Secondary gains that need addressing
- Blocking beliefs that need processing

A VOC of 6 may be ecological. Ask:

> "What prevents it from being a 7?"

If the answer reveals another target, note it for future processing.

## Quick Reference

1. Verify PC still fits (or adjust)
2. Check initial VOC (1-7)
3. Hold target + PC together
4. Apply bilateral stimulation
5. "What do you notice?" after each set
6. Continue until VOC = 7 or ecological
7. Address blocking beliefs if needed
8. Proceed to Body Scan when complete

## Clinical Considerations

- Don't force VOC to 7 if it's not realistic
- Blocking beliefs may indicate additional targets
- PC should feel true in the gut, not just intellectually
- Installation prepares the ground for Phase 6
- Document final VOC
- If doubts arise, they may need processing before installation is complete
