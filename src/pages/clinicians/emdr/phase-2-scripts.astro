          Explaining EMDR – Teenager Script
        </h2>

        <div class="script-box script-box-teen text-sm leading-relaxed">
          <p class="mb-3">"EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. I know that's a mouthful, so let me explain what it actually means.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">When something really stressful or scary happens, sometimes our brain has trouble processing it the way it normally would. It's like the memory gets stuck, and it can keep bothering us through nightmares, flashbacks, or feeling really anxious or upset when something reminds us of what happened.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">EMDR helps your brain process those stuck memories. While you think about the difficult memory, I'll have you follow my fingers with your eyes, or we can use tapping or sounds instead. This back-and-forth movement helps your brain do what it naturally does during REM sleep when you're dreaming – it helps process and file away the memory so it doesn't feel so overwhelming anymore.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">You don't have to tell me every detail of what happened. You're in control the whole time – you can stop whenever you need to. We'll also learn some coping skills first, so you have tools to help you feel calm and grounded.</p>

          <p>The goal isn't to forget what happened – you'll still remember it. But after EMDR, most people find that the memory doesn't bother them as much. It feels more like something that happened in the past, rather than something that's happening right now."</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="script-box script-box-child text-sm leading-relaxed">
          <p class="mb-3">"I'm going to teach you something really cool that can help with those scary/upsetting feelings you've been having.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">You know how when you fall asleep at night, your eyes move back and forth while you dream? That's your brain's way of sorting through everything that happened during the day – kind of like organizing your room, putting everything where it belongs.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">Sometimes when something really scary or bad happens, our brain has trouble putting that memory away. It's like having a really messy pile that keeps falling over and making a mess everywhere. That's why you might have bad dreams, or feel scared or upset when something reminds you of what happened.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">What we're going to do is help your brain organize that messy pile. While you think about what happened, you'll follow my fingers with your eyes, or we can tap on your hands, or listen to some beeping sounds. This helps your brain do its organizing job.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">You're the boss the whole time. If you want to stop, just hold up your hand like this [demonstrate stop signal]. We'll also learn some cool tricks to help you feel calm and safe, like imagining a special safe place.</p>

          <p>After we do this, you'll still remember what happened, but it won't feel so scary or upsetting anymore. It'll be more like an old story than something happening right now."</p>

          <p class="mb-3">"I'd like you to imagine some kind of container – something strong enough to hold whatever you put in it. It could be a safe, a vault, a lockbox, a trunk, a shipping container... anything that feels secure and unbreakable. What kind of container comes to mind?"</p>

          <p class="mb-3">"This container has a special feature – it can hold anything. Feelings, memories, thoughts, images – anything that's bothering you. Nothing can escape from it unless you choose to let it out."</p>

          <p class="mb-3">"First, let's imagine a super strong container – like a treasure chest, a magic box, a safe, or even a rocket ship that can fly far away! What kind of container sounds good to you?"</p>

          <p class="mb-3">"Let's practice! Think of something that's been a little bit annoying – maybe a time when you felt frustrated or a worry you have.

          <p class="mb-3">"This is a technique to help reduce uncomfortable feelings or sensations in your body. First, I'd like you to scan your body and notice if there's anywhere you feel tension, discomfort, or unpleasant sensations. Take a moment... Where do you notice it?"</p>

          <p class="mb-3">[Wait for response – note the location]</p>

          <p class="mb-3">"Now, if that sensation had a shape, what shape would it be?"</p>
          <p class="mb-3">"What size is it?"</p>
          <p class="mb-3">"What color is it?"</p>
          <p class="mb-3">"Does it have a temperature – warm or cold?"</p>
          <p class="mb-3">"If it had a texture, what would it be like?"</p>

          <p class="mb-3">"Now, I'd like you to imagine a healing light above your head. What color is this light – a color that feels healing, soothing, and positive to you?"</p>

          <p class="mb-3">[Wait for their answer]</p>

          <p class="mb-3">"Good. Imagine this [color] light beginning to flow down into the top of your head, like a gentle stream. Feel it flowing down through your head... your neck... your shoulders... flowing through your whole body..."</p>

          <p class="mb-3">"As this light reaches the area where you noticed that [shape/color], let it flow around it and through it. The light begins to resonate with the disturbance, vibrating it, loosening it. Allow the light to carry away any tension or discomfort, letting it drain out through your fingertips and toes..."</p>

          <p class="mb-3">[Add slow bilateral stimulation throughout]</p>

          <p>"Let the light continue to flow until your whole body feels filled with this healing, soothing energy. Take your time... When you're ready, open your eyes."</p>
