        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The Trauma Therapy Reference Guide exists to make evidence-based trauma treatment more accessible. We provide quick reference guides for clinicians and plain-language explanations for families — all completely free.
        </p>

        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
          Newly trained trauma therapists often leave their training programs with binders full of protocols and scripts. In between supervision sessions, they need quick access to reference materials — not to learn, but to refresh.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, families with children in trauma therapy struggle to find trustworthy information that explains treatment without jargon or fear-mongering.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built this site to serve both needs: concise clinical references for practitioners, and warm, accessible guides for families.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Evidence-based only</strong> — We only cover treatments with strong research support</li>
          <li><strong>Clinician-created</strong> — Content is written by licensed therapists with specialized training</li>
          <li><strong>Free forever</strong> — No paywalls, no subscriptions, no ads</li>
          <li><strong>Plain language</strong> — Family content is written to be understood, not to impress</li>
          <li><strong>Quick reference</strong> — Clinician content is scannable, not exhaustive</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          This site is created and maintained by licensed trauma therapists with specialized training in evidence-based treatments including EMDR, TF-CBT, and PCIT.

        <h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>

        <h3>For Clinicians</h3>
        <p>
          These reference guides are designed to support clinical practice, not replace formal training. They assume you have completed appropriate training in each protocol and are receiving appropriate supervision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always follow your training, supervision guidance, and professional judgment when implementing any protocol. These guides are not intended to teach you how to conduct therapy.
        </p>

        <h3>For Families</h3>
        <p>
          This site provides general educational information about trauma therapy. It is not medical advice and should not be used to diagnose or treat any condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always consult with qualified mental health professionals for guidance about your child's specific situation. If you have concerns about your child's therapy, please speak directly with their therapist.
