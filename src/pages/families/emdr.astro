        <h2>Understanding EMDR</h2>
        <p>
          EMDR stands for <strong>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing</strong>. It's a therapy that helps the brain process traumatic memories so they no longer cause distress.
        </p>
        <p>
          When something scary or overwhelming happens, our brains sometimes have trouble "filing away" that memory properly. It can feel like the memory is stuck, causing nightmares, anxiety, or strong reactions to reminders of what happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          EMDR helps the brain unstick these memories and process them like normal memories — ones that we can remember without being overwhelmed by them.
        </p>

        <Callout type="note" title="It's Evidence-Based">
          EMDR is recognized by the World Health Organization and the American Psychological Association as an effective treatment for trauma and PTSD in both children and adults.
        </Callout>

        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
          During EMDR, your child will think about a difficult memory while following the therapist's fingers with their eyes (or using taps or sounds). This back-and-forth movement helps the brain process the memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it like this: when we sleep and dream, our eyes move back and forth during REM sleep, and this helps our brain process the day's events. EMDR uses a similar process while awake to help process stuck memories.
        </p>

        <h2>What Happens in Sessions</h2>

        <h3>Building Trust First</h3>
        <p>
          EMDR isn't rushed. Before any memory work begins, the therapist will:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get to know your child and help them feel comfortable</li>
          <li>Learn about their history and what brought them to therapy</li>
          <li>Teach calming and coping techniques</li>
          <li>Create a "safe place" in their imagination they can go to anytime</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Processing Memories</h3>
        <p>
          When your child is ready, they'll begin working on difficult memories. During this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your child controls the pace — they can stop anytime</li>
          <li>They don't have to describe everything out loud</li>
          <li>The therapist guides them through safely</li>
          <li>Sessions end with calming exercises</li>
        </ul>

        <Callout type="tip" title="Your Child Is in Control">
          Your child can stop the process at any time by raising their hand or saying "stop." The therapist will never push them to continue if they're not ready.
        </Callout>

        <h2>What to Expect After Sessions</h2>
        <p>
          After EMDR sessions, your child might:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feel tired — processing memories takes energy</li>
          <li>Have vivid dreams — this is normal and usually temporary</li>
          <li>Notice thoughts or feelings related to the memory coming up</li>
          <li>Feel lighter or relieved as memories are processed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These responses are all normal parts of healing. If you're concerned about anything, always reach out to your child's therapist.
        </p>

        <h2>How You Can Support Your Child</h2>

        <h3>Before Sessions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep regular appointment times when possible</li>
          <li>Make sure your child has eaten and is rested</li>
          <li>Give them time to transition — don't rush to or from appointments</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>After Sessions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow quiet time if they need it</li>
          <li>Have a calm activity available (coloring, walking, music)</li>
          <li>Don't press them to talk about the session</li>
          <li>Follow any specific guidance from the therapist</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>At Home</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Practice the calming techniques together if your child wants</li>
          <li>Remind them they can use their "safe place" anytime</li>
          <li>Maintain predictable routines</li>
          <li>Be patient — healing isn't linear</li>
        </ul>

        <Callout type="note" title="For Caregivers">
          Supporting a child through trauma therapy can be emotionally demanding. Make sure you're taking care of yourself too. It's okay to ask the therapist for resources for your own wellbeing.

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <h3>Will my child have to relive their trauma?</h3>
        <p>
          EMDR doesn't require your child to describe their trauma in detail or relive it. They can process memories with minimal verbal description. The therapist will guide them through safely.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does EMDR take?</h3>
        <p>
          It varies for each child. Some see improvement in just a few sessions, while others with more complex histories may need longer. The therapist will discuss expectations with you.
        </p>

        <h3>Will my child remember their trauma differently?</h3>
        <p>
          EMDR doesn't change or erase memories. Your child will still remember what happened, but the memory should feel less distressing — more like a regular memory from the past.
        </p>

        <h3>Is EMDR safe for children?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. EMDR has been adapted specifically for children and is considered safe when conducted by a trained therapist. The therapist will pace the work appropriately for your child's age and needs.
